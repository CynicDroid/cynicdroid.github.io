<br><em><strong>Personal information you disclose to us
</strong></em><br>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the Services, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services or otherwise when you contact us. The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:
<br>•Personal Information Provided by You. We collect names; phone numbers; email addresses; usernames; billing addresses; and other similar information.
<br>•Social Media Login Data. We may provide you with the option to register with us using your existing social media account details, like your Facebook, Twitter or other social media account. If you choose to register in this way, we will collect the information described in the section called "HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?" below.
<br>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Information automatically collected
</em></strong><br>
<br>Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services. We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes. Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. You can find out more about this in our <a href="Cookie.html" class="text-info">Cookie Notice</a>.
<br>
<br><strong><em>The information we collect includes:
</em></strong><br>•Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called 'crash dumps') and hardware settings).
<br>•Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system and system configuration information.
<br>•Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Information collected through our Website</em></strong><br>We collect information regarding your geolocation, mobile device, push notifications, when you use our App. If you use our site, we also collect the following information:
<br>•Geolocation Information. We may request access or permission to and track location-based information from your mobile device, either continuously or while you are using our App, to provide certain location-based services. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.
<br>•Mobile Device Access. We may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device's sms messages, social media accounts, and other features. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.
<br>•Push Notifications. We may request to send you push notifications regarding your account or certain features of the App. If you wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device's settings.
<br>This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, for troubleshooting and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
<br>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</h2>
    </strong><br>We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.
<br>We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:
<br>•Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose.
<br>•Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.

<br>•Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

<br>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
    </strong><br>We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information. We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our <a href="Cookie.html" class="text-info">Cookie Notice</a>.
<br>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
    </strong><br>If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
<br>Our Services offers you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public on such social media platform. We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
<br>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    </strong><br>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law. We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
<br>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    </strong><br>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
<br>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
<br>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    </strong><br>In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK), you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time. In some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
<br> 
<br>If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">here</a>. If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html" class="text-success" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br>
<br>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <a href="mailto:cynicdroid@gmail.com" class="text-danger">cynicdroid@gmail.com</a>.<br>.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Account Information
</em></strong><br>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
<br>Contact us using the contact information provided.
<br>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
<br>
<br>Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. To opt-out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. For further information, please see our <a href="Cookie.html" class="text-danger">Cookie Notice.</a>
<br>
<br>Opting out of email marketing: You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below. You will then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we may still communicate with you, for example to send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. To otherwise opt-out, you may:
<br>Contact us using the contact information provided.
<br>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    </strong><br>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. 
<br>

        <h2 class="text-2xl">10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
    </strong><br>Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws. We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
